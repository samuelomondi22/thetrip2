            No better way to start the day than with a double double burger at In-N-Out.  
            After maneuvering the roads trying not to get in an accident cause the locals be driving recklessly,
             we made it to huntington beach. 
            We had fun body boarding. Brian got a good wave that pushed him about 30 feet to the shore. 
            Steve took this opportunity to get a nap on the beach :D
            The waves were about 5 feet. 
            We got to play soccer afterwards with some friends we met at the beach. Just having fun. 
            We then walked around the beach seeing whatâ€™s nice and buying some things along the way.
