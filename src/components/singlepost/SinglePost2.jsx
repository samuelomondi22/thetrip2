            What a way to start the morning, waking up to joyous kids.
            We got to talk about being righteous and how the world tries to tell us otherwise.
            As the world moves away from the gospel it becomes a hard task for us but we can do it :) 
            We got to play a battlefield game before saying out gooodbyes to Liz and Brian.

            On our way to Rexburg we passed through the 'Craters of the Moon'. 
            Craters of the Moon formed during eight major eruptive periods between 15,000 and 2000 years ago.
            Lava erupted from the Great Rift, a series of deep cracks that start near the visitor center and stretch 52 miles (84 km.) to the southeast.
            Yes, it covers a wide area. This was my first time ever seeing lava before so it was an amazing experience. 
            It is just like looking at a rock. Now I can check that off the list.

            Finally we were able to pick up Brian. 
            After a long hard work at school he is now able to have a rest and have some fun with us. 
            He does bring a joyous spirit. 
            It was awesome seeing him doing well and healthy and there is no better way to capture that moment than with a picture :)
