            Every day for the last several days there has been gushing rain for part of the day. 
            In Utah and Arizona and Nevada. Lots and lots of rain. Flooding all over the place. 
            I feel like I‚Äôm the Rain God from Washington bringing relief to this drought area. 
            ( I did get a text saying the governor wanted to thank me. ü§£)

            We got to Brent‚Äôs house late because of the horrible traffic and the flooding. 
            But it was nice to be there and we all had a good time. I mostly talked to Kalli about college. 
            I got distracted when Hannah said she wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer!  It‚Äôs good to see another capable engineer taking shape! 
            <br/>
            We talked too long and left too late. By the time we got to the hotel it was almost 1 AM. 
            The clerk was polite enough, but he had a screw loose, I think. 
            He said he only had one room left. But, well, the beds don‚Äôt have comforters on them (but it‚Äôs a warm night, he assured!) 
            and the couch has the cushions messed up, and the toilet had been used. ‚ÄúWhat about that room?!  Shall I give you the keys?‚Äù  
            Well, we didn‚Äôt take that room and ended up in a smaller room than we expected, and so I bargained for ‚Äúconsideration‚Äù.  
            It was an adventure!
