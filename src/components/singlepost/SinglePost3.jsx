            Yes, today we did go through three states in a day. We started off at Idaho before passing through Montana and ending at Wyoming.
            At Wyoming we got to spend most of our day in Yellowstone. Yellowstone is a national park with unique hydrothermal and geologic wonders.
            And a lot of people from around the world come to witnesses these wonders. We met a guy from South Africa and India.
